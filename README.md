# Mustacher

*Run mustache templates against a JSON file from the command line.*

## Instructions

This is a composer project so you'll need to do the following:

1. Install mustacher using composer with `composer global require vanilla/mustacher`.
2. Call `mustacher --help` for a list of command line options.

## Tips

Add `~/.composer/vendor/bin` to your path so that you can run all your composer command line tools.
